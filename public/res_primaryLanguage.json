      "description": "My name is Kris and I am a full-stack web developer focusing on the MERN stack. I am an Air Force Veteran who specialized in inter and intra service communications. I went to college for electronics and sustainable energy generation and control. Think industrial level solar and hydro-power and commercial electrical controls. I fell in love with software development while on parental leave when my daughter was born. I knew it was where I wanted to be in 5, 10 , 20 years and I am currently looking to fill a role for a  company with a structured mentorship program. I have worked with the MERN stack and use VSCode and github as my primary programming tools. I have experience working remotely on solo and group projects. I really love making accessible, interactive user interfaces.",
